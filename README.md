# directory-cleaner
The Directory Cleaner program is a program that periodically checks the root directory size of a specified folder and, if it exceeds a set threshold value, automatically deletes files to reduce the size below the threshold. (The criteria for deleting files is based on how old they are.)

## How to use
Set a disk volume threshold for cleaning up files in folders by moving the slider. Cleaner is triggered when the size of the disk volume for the specified folder exceeds the threshold.

Set the interval for the action (if not set, it will run immediately).
